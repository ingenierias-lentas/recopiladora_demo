# Authorizor

The authorizor service accepts requests from 3rd party OAuth providers and stores the generated OAuth tokens.

To simulate trigger OAuth flow, each provider will have a different process.

### Shopify
To trigger OAuth flow a Shopify store owner will install our app from their Shopify dashbaord.

Simulate this from the Shopify app's partner dashboard.

### Google Ads
To trigger OAuth flow a Google Ads account owner will visit the install URL from their browser.

Simulate by visiting '/auth/google-ads' from the browser for our application.
